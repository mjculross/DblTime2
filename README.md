NOTE: to allow full use of the buttons, DblTime
   loads in as an app (at the same menu level
   as "Settings" on the Pebble), not as a
   watchface . . . it just displays a watchface

Features (v 1.3):
- dual date & time displays
- adjustable # hours offset (-23 to +23) between
  primary & secondary time displays (default = 0)
- when # hours offset = 0, secondary date & time
  are not displayed (primary time display only)
- enable/disable snooze mode (display blanks after
  10 seconds) - default = enable
- enable/disable hourly chime mode (buzzes on the
  hour) - default = disable
- selectable mm/dd/yy vs dd/mm/yy date display -
  default = mm/dd/yy
- displays 12/24 hour format time (using current
  Pebble Settings)
- eliminated delay when showing time at start-up &
  when waking from snooze
