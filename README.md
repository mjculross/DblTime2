DblTIme2 - display two timezones

NOTE: to allow full use of the buttons, DblTime2
   loads in as an app (at the same menu level
   as "Settings" on the Pebble), not as a
   watchface . . . it just displays a watchface

Features (v 2.2):
- dual date & time displays
- with black-on-white for daytime displays & 
  white on black for nighttime displays
- adjustable # hours offset (-23:30 to +23:30) in
  30-minute increments, between primary &
  secondary time displays (default = 0:00)
- when # hours offset = 0, secondary date & time
  are not displayed (primary time display only)
- enable/disable snooze mode (display blanks after
  10 seconds) - default = enable
- enable/disable hourly chime mode (buzzes on the
  hour & activates display) - default = disable
- selectable mm/dd/yy vs dd/mm/yy date display -
  default = mm/dd/yy
- enable/disable display of seconds - default =
  enable
- displays 12/24 hour format time (using current
  Pebble Settings)
